      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you have a small business or startup? One of the greatest challenges posed to entrepreneurs is brand recognition and marketing. In the past this may have been a billboard or a classifieds ad. Today it’s websites, websites, websites. The world is online, and you should be too. I, as a computer science major, can help you get there with a personalized website. Not a cookie cutter, template website, but your own product. Client outreach, product information, and more; all in one place. It’s a forgone conclusion that successful businesses have websites. The only question is when do you want yours? </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The primary adience targeted by this website is adult homeowners. As a deck building service there is no need to 
          market to people who don't own homes. More specificaly the site will need to appeal to people who have medium to large yards, 
          old decks, or are remodeling, and live in the NOVA DC area. These people are the most likely to be in need of deck building/repair services.
          A secondary audience is anyoe who may refer someone in the primary audience to us. Or anyone who has related needs such as fence
          building/repair or other external framing needs.
