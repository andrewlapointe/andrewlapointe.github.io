          <h2>New Deck Construction</h2>
          <p>
            If you want a new deck or want to completely replace an old one, we
            can do it! New construction is the best option for customization,
            longevity, and safety. If there is an existing structure we start
            with a careful, clean removal. Then we build exactly the deck you
            want. There is no such thing as a “stock” design. Each customer gets
            their own tailored solution. We offer a variety of styles and
            material types such as: pressure treated wood, weather resistant
            hardwood, or composite. We will do our best to get the look you want
            for the price you can afford.

          <h2>Deck Resurfacing</h2>
          <p>
            Have an existing deck that is looking a bit grey? You may not need
            to replace it to have a “like new” appearance. Rather than go
            through the hassle of a new construction our team will sand back any
            old finish and weathering and apply out best deck stain. This will
            leave your deck refreshed and weatherized, ready to stand up to the
            elements.

          <h2>Deck Repair</h2>
          <p>
            This is usually the most affordable option for updating the safety
            of an existing structure. If there are broken boards, missing/loose
            rails, loose posts, or minor water damage we can fix it. Most
            problems are fixable without a total tear down. Don’t spend more
            than you need!

          <h2>Fence Construction</h2>
          <p>
            Want a new fence built? We have you covered. From privacy fences to
            decorative garden fences we can make it happen. We build our fences
            from the highest quality pressure treated wood that is rated for
            ground contact and use concrete to set them. Our fences can stand up
            to wind, rain, and years of use.
